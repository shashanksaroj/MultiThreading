wait() vs sleep() in Java
1. Purpose

wait()

Used for inter-thread communication

One thread waits until another thread notifies it

sleep()

Used to pause execution for a fixed time

No communication with other threads

2. Lock behavior (MOST IMPORTANT)

wait()

Releases the lock (monitor) on the object

Allows other threads to enter synchronized blocks

sleep()

Does NOT release the lock

Thread keeps holding the lock while sleeping

👉 This is usually the big differentiator interviewers want.

3. Where they belong

wait()

Must be called inside a synchronized block or method

Otherwise → IllegalMonitorStateException

sleep()

Can be called anywhere

No synchronization required

4. Who wakes the thread?

wait()

Woken up by:

notify()

notifyAll()

or spurious wakeup (rare but real)

sleep()

Wakes up automatically after time expires

Or if interrupted

5. Class they belong to

wait()

Method of Object class

sleep()

Static method of Thread class

6. Usage in Producer–Consumer

wait()

Used when buffer is full or empty

Thread waits until condition changes

sleep()

Used only to simulate delay

NOT used for synchronization

Tiny code example
synchronized (obj) {
    obj.wait();   // releases lock, waits for notify()
}

Thread.sleep(1000); // does NOT release lock

One-liner interview answers 🏆

“wait() releases the lock, sleep() does not.”

“wait() is for thread communication, sleep() is for time delay.”

“wait() must be called inside synchronized block.”

“sleep() belongs to Thread, wait() belongs to Object.”
